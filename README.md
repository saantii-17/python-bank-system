# üí∏üêç Banking System in Python

Welcome to the Banking System in Python! This project is an implementation of a basic banking system using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. The goal is to provide a platform for learning and practicing OOP, as well as understanding interactions between different entities in a banking environment.
___
## üìë Features

The system includes the following key features:

- **Clients**: Management of client information and their bank accounts.
- **Bank Accounts**: Creation and management of bank accounts, including deposits, withdrawals, and transfers.
- **Transactions**: Logging and viewing of bank transactions.
- **Ownership Flexibility**: Accounts can exist without an initial owner and can be assigned or transferred between clients.

## ‚öô Future improvements

- Graphical interface using `Tkinter`
- Enhanced data management security (hashing)
- Statistics and history

## üë®üèº‚Äçüè´ Example Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use the classes defined in this system:

```python
# Create an account
cuenta1 = Cuenta("001", "savings", 1000)

# Create a client
cliente1 = Cliente("John Doe", "98765432", "123 Fake St", "555-4321")

# Assign the account to the client
cliente1.asignar_cuenta(cuenta1)

# Display client and account information
cliente1.mostrar_info()
cuenta1.mostrar_info()
```
